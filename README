WebKey is a promitional button handed out that usually sends you to a
useless web addess.  This hack brings back the fun.  WebKey emulates a
keyboard and performs a series of commands without waiting for response:

1. Open Dock (Ctrl+F3)
2. Type safari, <enter>
3. Wait
4. Command+L (location bar)
5. promotional-address-here
6. <enter>

To hook this, you have to place safaria to the left of Safari in your dock,
so that it is chosen as a result

Or, if you've moved on from that browser you can name it whatever you want,
so long as it starts with s, or sa, or whatever you need for a unique prefix
